Make the hero/background video fully responsive on mobile and small screens (≤ 768px) with the following behavior and constraints:

Goal

The video must fill the viewport (no black bars), keep its aspect ratio, and must not cut off readable text in the video.

The video should be centered and stable as the mobile browser UI expands/collapses.

Implementation requirements

Container

Position: relative; Overflow: hidden.

Height: min(100svh, 100dvh) with fallbacks (100vh and -webkit-fill-available) to cover iOS/Android address-bar changes.

Width: 100%.

Video element

Absolutely positioned: inset: 0.

width: 100%, height: 100%, object-fit: cover, object-position: center.

Add playsinline and muted to prevent iOS fullscreen takeover.

Prevent zoom/crop of important content: if any overlay text gets clipped on very tall/short devices, reduce scale slightly (e.g., transform: scale(.98) for ≤ 360px width) or shift focal point with object-position (e.g., center 15%).

Media queries

≤ 480px: keep object-fit: cover (to remove black bars) and adjust object-position to keep the title area visible; allow a small scale down (0.96–0.98) if needed.

481–768px: similar rules; ensure no letterboxing; tweak object-position to center the hero title.

≥ 769px (laptop/desktop): keep current desktop behavior (already working).

Safe-area & layout

Reserve space for any sticky floating buttons (language/fab) so they don’t overlap key video text (use padding-bottom on the container when those buttons are visible).

Ensure no scroll-jank when the URL bar hides/shows (use 100svh/100dvh).

Performance

Add preload="auto" (or metadata if heavy), autoplay, muted, loop, playsinline.

Provide a poster image for slow connections.

Acceptance checklist (must pass):

No black bars on iPhone 12/13/14, Pixel 6/7, Galaxy S series, and small 360×640 devices.

No cropped/hidden hero words at top or bottom in portrait.

Rotating to landscape keeps the video centered without letterboxing.

Floating action buttons do not cover hero text.

Lighthouse: no layout shift from the video when loading (CLS ~0).
