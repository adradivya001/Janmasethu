

Refactor the site header navigation so that only **4 main sections** are always visible; all other sections move into a **“More”** dropdown positioned **before the search bar**, maintaining the same horizontal alignment. Keep the language toggle at the far right as it is.

### Requirements

1. **Config-driven nav (priority based)**

* Create a config (TS/JS or JSON) with **all sections**, each having:

  ```ts
  type NavItem = { id:string; label:{en:string; hi:string; te:string}; href:string; priority:number };
  ```
* Example initial data (use my current routes):

  ```json
  [
    {"id":"home","label":{"en":"Home","hi":"होम","te":"హోమ్"},"href":"/","priority":1},
    {"id":"knowledge","label":{"en":"Knowledge Hub","hi":"नॉलेज हब","te":"నాలెడ్జ్ హబ్"},"href":"/knowledge","priority":2},
    {"id":"treatments","label":{"en":"Treatments","hi":"ट्रीटमेंट्स","te":"చికిత్సలు"},"href":"/treatments","priority":3},
    {"id":"sakhi","label":{"en":"Sakhi","hi":"सखी","te":"సఖి"},"href":"/sakhi","priority":4},
    {"id":"life","label":{"en":"Life Stages","hi":"लाइफ स्टेजेस","te":"జీవిత దశలు"},"href":"/life","priority":5},
    {"id":"stories","label":{"en":"Success Stories","hi":"कहानियाँ","te":"విజయ కథలు"},"href":"/stories","priority":6},
    {"id":"blog","label":{"en":"Blog","hi":"ब्लॉग","te":"బ్లాగ్"},"href":"/blog","priority":7},
    {"id":"experts","label":{"en":"Experts","hi":"एक्सपर्ट्स","te":"నిపుణులు"},"href":"/experts","priority":8},
    {"id":"tools","label":{"en":"Tools","hi":"टूल्स","te":"సాధనాలు"},"href":"/tools","priority":9},
    {"id":"investors","label":{"en":"Investors","hi":"इन्वेस्टर्स","te":"ఇన్వెస్టర్లు"},"href":"/investors","priority":10}
  ]
  ```
* Logic: **sort by `priority`**, take **first 4** as **primary**, push the rest into **More**.

2. **Layout & placement**

* Order in header: **Logo | \[Primary (4)] | More ▼ | Search | Language toggle**.
* The **More** trigger is a **button** (not an anchor) with caret icon.
* Keep spacing consistent with current header; same typography/tokens.

3. **Dropdown behavior (desktop)**

* Clicking or pressing **Enter/Space** on “More” opens a **dropdown menu** listing the remaining items.
* Menu appears **under the More button**, aligned to it; auto-positions within viewport if near the right edge.
* Each item is a standard anchor `<a href="…">` using the localized label.
* Close menu on: ESC, click outside, or tabbing out.

4. **Mobile behavior**

* In the existing mobile menu/drawer, show **all items** as a single list (no More on mobile).
  (If there’s already a hamburger—reuse it; otherwise implement a simple drawer.)

5. **i18n support (EN/HI/TE)**

* Read current language from existing global state or `localStorage.lang` (`'en' | 'hi' | 'te'`).
* Render labels using `item.label[currentLang]` with fallback to English.
* The “More” label itself must be localized:

  * EN: **More**
  * HI: **और**
  * TE: **మరిన్ని**

6. **Accessibility**

* Use proper ARIA for the menu:

  * `button` with `aria-haspopup="menu"` and `aria-expanded`.
  * Menu container with `role="menu"`, items with `role="menuitem"`.
  * Focus management: focus first item when opened; return focus to the More button when closed.
  * Keyboard: Up/Down to move, Enter to activate, ESC to close.

7. **Styling**

* Match current header style (translucent/rounded).
* Dropdown: white card, 12–16px padding, 8–10px item spacing, subtle shadow, 12px radius.
* Hover/active state: light gradient or subtle background.
* Maintain same **baseline and vertical rhythm** as existing nav.

8. **Files/changes**

* If React:

  * Add `src/config/navItems.ts` (or `.json`) with the items above.
  * Update `Header/Nav.tsx` (or equivalent) to:

    * Split into `PrimaryNav`, `MoreMenu`, `Search`, `LangToggle`.
    * Implement priority logic + i18n labels.
* If plain HTML:

  * Build the nav list from the config with a small JS that injects primary items + More dropdown.
  * Keep existing markup for search and language toggle; insert the More node **before** the search bar.

9. **Acceptance criteria**

* Exactly **4 items** visible next to logo on desktop; **More** appears **before** the search bar.
* All remaining sections show inside **More**; links work.
* Language change updates labels for primary, More, and items inside the dropdown.
* Keyboard and screen-reader navigation work as specified.
* Mobile menu shows **all items** without More.
* No layout shift or overflow on narrow desktops (≥1024px).

**After implementation, please reply with:**

* Which files you created/edited.
* How to change which 4 items are primary (confirm it’s just the `priority` values).
* The function or component name that renders the More dropdown.
