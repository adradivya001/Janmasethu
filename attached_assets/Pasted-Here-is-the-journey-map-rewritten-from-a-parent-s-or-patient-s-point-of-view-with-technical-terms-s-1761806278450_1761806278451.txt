Here is the journey map rewritten from a parent's or patient's point of view, with technical terms simplified.

Stage 1: Thinking of Parenthood
How I'm Feeling: Hopeful, but also anxious and uncertain. We keep asking ourselves, "Are we really ready for this?"

My Worries:

Everyone keeps asking when we're going to have a baby, and the pressure is a lot.

We're worried about the money. Can we actually afford a child right now?

I'm confused about what I should be eating or what lifestyle changes to make.

I hear so many different "facts" and stories about fertility, it's hard to know what's true.

How Sakhi Helps Me:

Provides clear, local info (from trusted sources) on things like food, age, and health.

Offers simple checklists to help us think about financial planning.

Shares articles and thoughts that make me feel less alone in this.

Stage 2: Trying Naturally
How I'm Feeling: Optimistic at first, but with each month that passes, I feel more and more anxious.

My Worries:

Trying to track my cycle is confusing and stressful.

The internet is full of conflicting advice like "eat this, not that." Who do I believe?

The pressure seems to build up every single month.

How Sakhi Helps Me:

Gives me a simple way to track my cycle, with helpful tips along the way.

Sends gentle reminders about healthy habits.

Helps me turn my vague worries into clear questions, like "What lifestyle changes actually make a difference?"

Offers quick tips to help me manage stress and stay calm.

Stage 3: Exploring Options (IUI, IVF, Donor)
How I'm Feeling: Completely overwhelmed. I sometimes feel ashamed, and I'm tired of having to make so many decisions.

My Worries:

When is the "right time" to see a specialist? Have we waited too long?

I'm lost trying to understand all the options—IUI, IVF, donors. What do these words even mean for us?

The clinics seem so complicated, and I have no idea what to expect.

This is all so expensive, and it’s scary to think about the costs.

How Sakhi Helps Me:

Gives me a checklist of "What to ask my doctor" at our first appointment so I feel prepared.

Shows me short, simple videos from real doctors explaining the different procedures.

Provides a safe place to upload and keep all my test reports organized.

Gives me an easy option to share my information with my chosen clinic when I'm ready.

Answers my questions about costs, success rates, and the process in my local area.

Stage 4: During Treatment (IVF/IUI)
How I'm Feeling: Stressed, vulnerable, and terrified that it won't work.

My Worries:

The medication schedule is so complicated. I'm scared I'll mess it up.

I don't know what's going to happen during the procedures, and it makes me nervous.

I'm so afraid of failure. What if it doesn't work? Will it be my fault?

How Sakhi Helps Me:

Sends medication reminders right to my phone (WhatsApp/SMS) so I don't miss a dose.

Gives me simple explainers for each step, like "Here’s what happens on Day 3."

Lets me send non-urgent questions to a nurse anytime, so I don't have to call and wait on hold.

Provides a checklist so I can see I've completed everything I need for each stage.

Stage 5: Pregnancy
How I'm Feeling: So relieved and excited, but now I have a whole new set of anxieties.

My Worries:

It's hard to find all the information I need for my specific week of pregnancy.

My family and friends are telling me to do one thing, but my doctor says something else. It's confusing!

Now we need to start planning and budgeting for the hospital delivery.

How Sakhi Helps Me:

Shows me a timeline of my pregnancy, with helpful info for each week.

Gives me simple nutrition checklists for each trimester.

Shares videos on what to expect in the coming months.

Helps me prepare for my doctor's visits by suggesting questions to ask.

Stage 6: Delivery & Post-Delivery
How I'm Feeling: Full of joy, but also completely exhausted and overwhelmed.

My Worries:

Everyone is focused on the baby, but I'm worried about my own recovery.

I'm hearing so many myths and facts about baby care, I don't know what's right.

I feel a bit down and weepy, but I'm scared to tell anyone I might be feeling "post-partum blues."

How Sakhi Helps Me:

Provides a post-delivery checklist for both my recovery and the baby's basic needs.

Connects me to resources for mental health support, just in case I'm feeling low.

Sends reminders for the baby's vaccination schedule.

Lets me keep asking questions, this time about the newborn.
