Objective:
To develop a static clinic login page and a static, functional dashboard for the Samnada clinic, providing an intuitive and efficient user experience.

User Authentication and Login Page:

Create a dedicated static login page, which provides inputs for username and password.
Include a "Login" button that redirects to the dashboard upon successful authentication.
Dashboard Structure:

The dashboard will be a separate static page consisting of modular components that display relevant data.
Ensure all dashboard components (widgets, graphs, statistics) are static yet interactive when applicable.
Navigation Implementation:

Utilize a navigation sidebar that lists all functionality accessible to the user based on their role:
Dashboard
Lead Management
Appointments
AI Recommendations
Patients
Emotional Support
Reports
Settings
Make sure the navigation is easily accessible and responsive.
Static Dashboard Components:

Key Metrics Display:
Create sections for displaying new leads, appointments, conversion rates, etc.
Visualization Components:
Integrate charts and graphs to showcase lead conversion funnels and other analytics using static data for development.
Task Management:
Include components to manage tasks and appointments, allowing users to interact with static mock data.
Firm Design Elements:

Apply a calming color scheme, primarily soft purples and whites throughout the site.
Use accessible and readable typography to enhance user engagement on both the login and dashboard pages.
User Experience Considerations:

Ensure smooth transitions between the login page and the dashboard upon successful login.
Provide feedback on key actions (e.g., loading states, success/failure messages) on the dashboard.
Static Data Handling:

For the development phase, create mock data within the components to mimic real data interactions.
Utilize methods from the existing codebase to handle data fetching and operations statically for testing.
Deployment Considerations:

Prepare the application for static deployment using Replit's capabilities.
Ensure all static files are built into the designated directory and configured properly for deployment.
Testing and Validation:

Conduct thorough testing of all static components to verify they function correctly without live API connections.
Validate user roles, ensuring that dashboard elements display appropriately per each user's permissions.
