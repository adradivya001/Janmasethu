Context
- Stack: React + TypeScript + Tailwind on Replit.
- I already have a primary Button component used across the site.
- Do NOT change layout, alignment, spacing, text/content, or any other components. Keep everything responsive. Use my existing theme tokens for colors; do NOT introduce hardcoded hex values.

Goal
- Add an opt-in animation to my existing Button that mimics a sprite/icon shift:
  • Hover effect: subtle lift and a background/icon slide (as if a sprite moves vertically or shifts frames).
  • Click/Active effect: pressed feedback with a distinct frame/position and a slight scale-down.
- The effect should feel premium, responsive, and work in light/dark themes automatically.

Behavior (what the button should do)
1) Default (idle):
   - Button looks exactly like my current design.
   - An icon/graphic is visually aligned on the left (inside the button) with enough left padding so text never overlaps.
   - No layout or content changes anywhere it’s used.

2) Hover (pointer over):
   - The icon/graphic appears to “slide” to a second frame/state (e.g., a background/position change).
   - The button gently elevates (shadow/depth) and slightly scales up (very subtle).
   - Transition duration around 250–300ms; smooth and consistent.

3) Active/Click (pointer down) and Focus-visible:
   - The icon/graphic shifts to a third frame/state (distinct from hover).
   - The button gives pressed feedback (slight scale-down) and shows a clear focus/active emphasis that meets accessibility.
   - On keyboard focus, the state should be clearly visible without moving layout.

4) Accessibility & Responsiveness:
   - Keep ARIA roles and semantics of my existing Button.
   - Focus styles must be obvious; keyboard users should clearly see focus.
   - Works properly from 320px to desktop; long labels or wrapped text must remain aligned with the icon.
   - Respect my existing design tokens for text, background, border, shadow; do not add new color values.

Integration
- Make this animation opt-in via a prop or class on my existing Button (e.g., `animated`), without breaking any current usage.
- Do not change copy, sizes, or container layouts; only enhance the visual behavior on hover/click/focus.
- Ensure there’s no layout shift when the effect triggers.

Acceptance Criteria
- When I enable the feature on any Button, I get:
  • Default: current look and spacing, icon present and aligned.
  • Hover: smooth lift + icon/graphic frame shift (sprite-like).
  • Active/Focus: pressed feel + distinct frame, accessible focus.
- No hardcoded hex colors; use my theme tokens.
- No regressions to alignment, content, or responsiveness.
- Provide a tiny usage example showing my existing Button with the animation enabled (no changes to its text or layout).
